**My experience during the setup**

I had a difficult time getting my code to run properly. I had issues with getting my code to be processed on bluestack. My bluestacks was not showing my webpage at all but after fighting, i have made it work.
**The setup steps i followed**

- I created a file
- I then went and opened a new folder in Visual sudio code
- Opened the program i name
- I changed the text to display my name in the device
- Checked that everything was good
- Ran this on blue stacks where once i opened bluestack, I opened run for blue stacks and let it do what it needed to do.
- Once everything was up and sunning it presented my app screen that says Hello, My name is Leander
- After everything seemed good I then proceeded to go and open intergrated terminal where i then pushed my code to git hub and went through the process of pushing the code.
